## Volcanoes: VEI vs. Last Eruption

OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

My project focuses on the explosivity of volcanoes vs. how often they erupt. I predicted that the more explosive the volcano is, the longer it would take for enough magma to build up inside to create an eruption. After analyzing the date of every volcano's last eruption and the VEI of that eruption, I concluded that most explosive volcanoes haven't erupted as recently as non-explosive volcanoes.
